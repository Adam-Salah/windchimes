# Wind chimes
### By Adam Salah

## Introduction
This project aims to provide a realistic simulation of wind chimes in the browser. I integrated React Three Fiber to build the 3D application on the web using Typescript.
The final goal is to have fully simulated physics for the chimes as well as realistic noise generation!

## Implemented features
- Basic 3D navigation (Panning + rotation).
- Custom cursor with object detection (no model yet).

## To do
- Wind chime models.
- Rope physics simulation.
- User interaction with the wind chimes.
- Weather elements. (ex. wind)
- Noise generation based on contact points.
- Website around the canvas to facilitate navigation.
- 3D backgrounds.
- Share it around!
